# Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection
💳 Online Payments Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview Online payment fraud is one of the major challenges in digital transactions. This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing transaction patterns and customer behavior, the system classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

🎯 Problem Statement With the rapid growth of digital payments, fraudulent activities have increased significantly. Financial institutions need an automated and intelligent system to detect suspicious transactions in real time to reduce financial losses and enhance customer trust.

💡 Proposed Solution This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to: • Analyze historical transaction data • Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering • Train classification models • Evaluate model performance • Predict fraudulent transactions

🛠️ Technology Stack • Programming Language: Python • Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn • Modeling Techniques: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree • Deployment: Flask • Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
